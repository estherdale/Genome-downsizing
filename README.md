Title: Genome downsizing in polyploid angiosperm lineages is common, differs between life forms, and does not reduce ecological niche size

A study examining the prevalence and ecological consequences of genome downsizing using genome sizes of 209 species from 16 genera with multiple ploidy levels in New Zealand.

FILES
Genome downsizing analysis script.R - an R script for doing the analyses. The analysis script is split into sections, each section describes what that part does, and these can be run separately if needed. The data files are provided or for data that is accessible from the original source the DOI for accessing the required data is commented in the script.

Genome size April 24.csv - the data table of genomic data including genome size (Total DNA), number of chromosomes (2n), ploidy level (Ploidy), and whether species were a base species in the analyses (Base.species = 1)

Genomic downsizing species heights.csv - the data table of morphological trait data.

Genus size in NZ genomic downsizing.csv - number of species in New Zealand for each genus (Clade.size)
