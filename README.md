This repository contains scripts and data for running the analyses in R from "Genome downsizing in polyploid angiosperm lineages is common, differs between life forms, and does not reduce ecological niche size", Dale et al.

The analysis script is split into sections, each section describes what that part does, and these can be run separately if needed.
The data files are provided or for data that is accessible from the original source the DOI for accessing the required data is commented in the script.
